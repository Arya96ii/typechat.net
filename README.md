# TypeChat.NET

TypeChat.NET is an experimental project that makes it easy to build natural language interfaces using Types.

It applies the ideas of [TypeChat](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeChat) to .NET and integrates them with the [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel). 

TypeChat.NET consists of the following assemblies:
- TypeChat
- TypeChat.Schema: Experimental classes for exporting .NET types as Typescript schema. 
- TypeChat.SK: Integration with Semantic Kernel. 

TypeChat.NET is still in **active development** with very frequent changes. 

## TypeChat ##
Brings TypeChat to .NET.
- Json Translators
- Json Validators

The library is an ***in-progress*** port of the TypeChat library with .NET idiom introduced suitably. But it does not implement bindings to a specific AI model or API. For that you use the Typechat.sk library below, or roll your own.

## TypeChat.Schema ##
The library provides exporters for .NET Types to Typescript schema. 

Includes support for dynamic export at runtime, including with ***each request*** to the AI. This is needed for scenarios where the schema must include dynamic lists, such as relevant product names or lists of players in a team. TypeChat itself does not current support this. 

## TypeChat.SK ##
TypeChat.SK makes it easy to get ***strongly typed*** .NET objects from the [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel).

With auto-generation of Typescript schema:

        using Microsoft.TypeChat.SemanticKernel;

        // Create typed service
        _service = KernelFactory.JsonTranslator<SemanticResponse>(Config.LoadOpenAI());
        // Get typed responses
        SentimentResponse response = await service.TranslateAsync("Its a good day!");

OR with the schema for the Type generated by hand or other means:

        using Microsoft.TypeChat.SemanticKernel;

        Schema schema = Schema.Load("./SentimentSchema.ts");
        var service = KernelFactory.JsonTranslator<SentimentResponse>(
            schema,
            "gpt-35-turbo",
            _config.OpenAI
        );
        SentimentResponse response = await service.TranslateAsync("Its a good day!");


The library provides:
- LLM bindings for TypeChat using the Semantic Kernel.

# Getting Started 
## Building
You will need Visual Studio 2022. VS Code is not tested. 
- Load **typechat.sln** from the root directory of your . 
- Restore packages
- Build

## Examples

To see TypeChat in action, we recommend exploring the [TypeChat example projects](./examples). 

### Api Key
- You will need to provide an **Open API key**
- Go to the ***examples*** folder in the solution
- Create appSettings.Development.json
- Add your Api Key

### Inputs
- Each example includes an **input.txt** with sample input. 
- Pass the input file as an argument to run the example in **batch mode**.
